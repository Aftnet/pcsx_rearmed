PCSX-ReARMed - yet another PCSX fork


About
-----

PCSX ReARMed is yet another PCSX fork based on the PCSX-Reloaded project,
which itself contains code from PCSX, PCSX-df and PCSX-Revolution. This
version is ARM architecture oriented and features MIPS->ARM recompiler by
Ari64. It was created for Pandora handheld, but should be usable on other
devices after some code adjustments.

It does not, however, have anything in common with similar psx4all and
pcsx4all projects, except that all of these are PCSX ports.


Usage
-----

This version features a framebuffer driven menu that can be used to run
games and configure the emulator.

Supportd CD image formats:
- .cue/.bin
- .toc/.bin
- .img
- .mds
- .Z/.Z.table

CDDA (CD audio) support requires .cue/.bin format.
